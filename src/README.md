## Project Layout

This project layout is based on the Clean Architecture pattern, which is a software architecture pattern that separates the application into three main layers:

* **Domain:** Contains the core business logic of the application.
* **Application:** Contains the controllers and services that handle HTTP requests and responses and perform business logic operations.
* **Infrastructure:** Contains the data access and repository implementation.

### Folder Breakdown

**src/Application/Controllers:**

* Contains the controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
* Each controller is responsible for a specific set of related tasks.
* For example, you might have a `ProjectsController` that handles CRUD operations on projects.

**src/Application/Services:**

* Contains the services that perform business logic operations.
* Each service is responsible for a specific set of related tasks.
* For example, you might have a `ProjectService` that handles CRUD operations on projects and other business logic related to projects.

**src/Domain/Entities:**

* Contains the entities that represent the core business logic of the application.
* Each entity represents a real-world concept, such as a project, issue, or user.

**src/Domain/Interfaces:**

* Contains the interfaces that define the contracts for the domain entities and services.
* This helps to ensure that the domain logic is loosely coupled and can be easily tested.

**src/Infrastructure/Data:**

* Contains the data access code, such as Entity Framework Core DbContext and repository implementations.

**src/Infrastructure/Repositories:**

* Contains the repository implementations that use the Entity Framework Core DbContext to access data from the database.

### File Structure

Each folder contains one or more files, depending on the needs of the application. For example, the `src/Domain/Entities` folder might contain a `Project.cs` file that represents the project entity.

### Conclusion

This project layout is a good starting point for implementing a Clean Architecture application in .NET 9.0. However, you may need to adjust it based on the specific needs of your application.
